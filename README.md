## Problem Statement

- AtliQ Mart, a growing FMCG manufacturer headquartered in Gujarat, India, operational in Surat, Ahmedabad, and Vadodara, aims to expand to other metros/Tier 1 cities within the next 2 years.
- The company is facing issues where key customers did not renew their annual contracts due to service issues, speculated to be caused by late or incomplete deliveries.
- Management wants to resolve these service issues before expanding to new cities.
- The Supply Chain team needs to track 'On-time' and 'In Full' delivery service levels daily to respond swiftly to these issues.

## Solution

- Measure ‚ÄòOn-time delivery (OT) %‚Äô, ‚ÄòIn-full delivery (IF) %‚Äô, and ‚ÄòOn Time in full (OTIF) %‚Äô of customer orders daily against target service levels.
- Create a dashboard to monitor these metrics according to stakeholder requirements.
- Provide relevant insights beyond the metrics list and stakeholder meeting requirements.
