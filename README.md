## Problem Statement

- AtliQ Mart, a growing FMCG manufacturer headquartered in Gujarat, India, operational in Surat, Ahmedabad, and Vadodara, aims to expand to other metros/Tier 1 cities within the next 2 years.
- The company is facing issues where key customers did not renew their annual contracts due to service issues, speculated to be caused by late or incomplete deliveries.
- Management wants to resolve these service issues before expanding to new cities.
- The Supply Chain team needs to track 'On-time' and 'In Full' delivery service levels daily to respond swiftly to these issues.

## Solution

- Measure ‚ÄòOn-time delivery (OT) %‚Äô, ‚ÄòIn-full delivery (IF) %‚Äô, and ‚ÄòOn Time in full (OTIF) %‚Äô of customer orders daily against target service levels.
- Create a dashboard to monitor these metrics according to stakeholder requirements.
- Provide relevant insights beyond the metrics list and stakeholder meeting requirements.

## Step-by-Step Journey

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Gathering and Initial Analysis with CSV Files
- **Data Access**: Accessed sales data from CSV files provided by the company.
- **High-Level Analysis**: Reviewed the CSV files to understand data structure and key metrics.
- **Data Extraction**: Relevant data from the CSV files were extracted for further processing.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Cleaning in Power BI
- **Connecting Data**: Imported CSV data into Power BI.
- **ETL Process**: Conducted ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes within Power BI to clean and prepare the data.
- **Currency Conversion**: Standardized transaction currencies to ensure consistency.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Measure Creation and Visualization in Power BI
- **Creating Measures**: Developed necessary measures using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for meaningful insights.
- **Initial Report**: Created initial visualizations and shared the report with stakeholders for feedback.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Creating a Compelling Dashboard
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Developed an interactive and visually appealing dashboard in Power BI.
- **Highlighting Key Insights**: Highlighted key sales metrics, regional performance, and trends over time.
